# Project Summary
This project was my first full experience with C#. This project also allowed me to gain website-building experience, by creating a website using C# and SQL to query from a database. I was able to create dynamic content on a website in order to display different data, including graphs and tables. The data used in this project was from the Chicago Transit Authority.

# Topics Learned Upon Completion
